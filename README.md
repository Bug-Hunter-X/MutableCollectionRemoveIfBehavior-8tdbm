This repository demonstrates a common Kotlin bug involving the unexpected behavior of `removeIf` when used with mutable collections.  The `removeIf` function iterates over the collection and removes elements based on a given predicate. However, directly modifying the collection during this iteration can lead to unexpected omissions or incorrect results. This example highlights the issue with both `MutableList` and `MutableMap` and provides a solution.  The `bug.kt` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.kt` presents a safer and more reliable approach to removing elements.
